******Aquarium**

**Project Objective****


To design and develop an interactive animated aquarium using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that simulates a lively underwater environment through moving fish, animated waves, bubbles, and responsive elements. The project aims to demonstrate core web-development concepts—such as animation, DOM manipulation, user interaction, and SVG graphics—while creating a visually engaging and dynamic digital experience.

**Final Conclusion**

The animated aquarium project successfully demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to create a visually engaging and interactive digital environment. Through dynamic elements such as moving fish, animated waves, rising bubbles, and responsive plant motions, the project simulates an appealing underwater world. The inclusion of user interaction—allowing fish to be stopped or restarted—enhances both functionality and user engagement. Overall, the project effectively showcases core web development concepts, creative animation techniques, and interactive design, resulting in a cohesive and immersive animation experience.
